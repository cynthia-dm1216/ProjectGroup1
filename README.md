## Tasks

1) After the wireframe, create the mock up 
2) Design the HTML/CSS
3) We need to set up a front end UI that can take in an input from the user:
    * Superhero name
4) Once we have this search information, we will use the backend to communicate with the APIs and return back:
    * Superhero information
    * Wallpapers closely related to said superhero
5) Integrate with Javascript
